    <h3 class="heading three"><strong>What is an Italian Wedding Soup?</strong></h3>
    <p class="para">Italian wedding soup is a hearty Italian soup consisting of noodles, vegetables, meatballs, and broth. It was originally a "peasant dish," meaning it's made from inexpensive ingredients that anyone could find.</p>
    <h3 class="heading three"><strong>Why is it called Italian Wedding Soup?</strong></h3>
    <p class="para">Even though it's called "wedding soup," this soup has nothing to do with weddings. The name comes from the Italian phrase "minestra maritata," which actually means married soup. But it's not the marriage we think of — it's actually referring to the marriage of the ingredients and the flavor it produces.</p>
    <h2 class="heading two">Types of Ingredients in an Italian Wedding Soup:</h2>
        <ul class="list one"><li><strong>Meatballs:</strong>Combine ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, Parmesan, basil, and onion powder to create the meatballs.</li>
            <li><strong>Broth:</strong>This recipe calls for chicken broth — though reviewers have had luck using different broths too.</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong>This soup has escarole and carrots. You can also add onions or celery if you want more color.</li>
            <li><strong>Pasta:</strong>This particular recipe calls for orzo pasta, which is what we like to use. But you can really use any small pasta you have on hand, like ditalini or acini de pepe.</li>
        </ul>

Stir in escarole, orzo, carrot, and meatballs and return to boil.
